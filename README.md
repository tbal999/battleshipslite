# battleshipslite
A simple version of battleships, where:

- all the "ships" are 1x1
- you have three ships
- the computer has three ships
- it's a 5x5 map that looks something like this:

0 1 2 3 4 5
1 0 0 0 0 0
2 0 0 0 0 0
3 0 0 0 0 0
4 0 0 0 0 0
5 0 0 0 0 0

This project helped me with learning:

lists,
matrices,
for & while loops,
if and else statements
